## Project Overview

The goal of the current incarnation of this project will be to develop a successful REU proposal for the NSF bringing together evolutionary biology and evolutionary computation.

## Efforts required during Winter/Summer 2025 semesters:

* Development of sample modules for undergraduate students to participate in for experiential learning in evolutionary biology and evolutionary computation.
* Development of potential research project frameworks for participants to use as a 'jumping-off' point for research publication activities.
* Support grant writing activities
* Participate in regular meetings with cross-disciplinary faculty and mentors
